**Jarvis**

An AI-powered real-time assistant built with Python, LiveKit, and OpenAI — combining voice, vision, and reasoning to create an interactive and intelligent system.

This project highlights my practical experience in AI orchestration, API integration, and real-time system design.

## Project Overview

Jarvis is designed to act as a smart virtual co-pilot capable of perceiving, reasoning, and responding dynamically.  
It uses LiveKit for real-time audio and video streaming and OpenAI APIs for natural conversation, decision-making, and multimodal understanding.
